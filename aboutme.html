       <h1>about Me</h1>
       <p>I'm working towards being a teacher when I'm older. I love kids and loving help people whenever I can.
        The reason I want to be a teacher is because everyday I go to school and see different teachers teach in 
        there own way, some are mean or strict and others are happy or nice. I always wanted to be a teacher to be
        with kids and make a meaning to there life and show that learning can be fun. I'm working towards the goals
        by being nice to everyone and babysitting. I am trying hard in school so I can teach what I'm learning and 
        know what to do. Well the first way i'll be able to make my goal is to have a bachelor's degree so I can be 
        out of college successfully. Second I need to work hard on my studies and be the smartest I can be, to help 
        achieve my goal. All my values for success are a good education because that always comes first. Short term 
        goals I want to accomplish are making good money, graduating, and being the best person I can be, From kind 
        and caring, to smart and helpful. The character traits I want to be known for are creativity, smart, kind, 
        caring, helpful, sweet, pretty, etc... I want to be known as a good person, not some bad person who is mean
        and grumpy all the time. I want people to be really close friends with me and hangout with me whenever they
        can.</p>
